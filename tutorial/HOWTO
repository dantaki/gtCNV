#This quick tutorial is purely an example. The downsampled BAM file of NA12878 chr22 does not contain adequate coverage for accurate CNV genotyping

## PREPROCESSING 
##you MUST run this step first

$ gtCNV --preprocess -b tutorial/bam.list -o tutorial_preprocessing.out

# output is located in 'gtCNV_preprocessing_out' directory

## GENOTYPING 

$ gtCNV --genotype -b tutorial/bam.list -i tutorial/1kg_p3_integratedSV_cnv_chr22.bed --pre gtCNV_preprocessing_out/tutorial_preprocessing.out -o tutorial_cnv.out

# output is located in 'gtCNV_genotyping_out' directory. If the file exists, gtCNV will append to the file.
